Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I've created a website for a charted accountant with index.html as homepage and three other html webpages which will be redirected based on the link opted.

I've chosen style.css as my main stylesheet 

I've also used flexbox and @media query for printing and displaying content in phone in an organised manner inside index.html

I've used bootstrap and its grid model in services.html page 

I've used sass.scss file which will be converted to css file -"css.css" which is used by contact.html webpage.

I've used css grid display in carrer.html page and used all the tags mentioned in one of the four webpages.
